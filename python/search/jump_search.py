    - Definition: Like Binary Search, Jump Search (or Block Search) is a
    searching algorithm for sorted arrays. The basic idea is to check fewer
    elements (than linear search) by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping
    some elements in place of searching all elements.

    - Complexity: O(√n) - because we do search by blocks of size √n.
