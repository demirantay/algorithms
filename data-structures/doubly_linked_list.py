    Data Structure: Doubly Linked List
    ---
    Desc: In computer science, a doubly linked list is a linked data structure
    that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each
    node contains two fields, called links, that are references to the previous
    and to the next node in the sequence of nodes. The beginning and ending
    nodes' previous and next links, respectively, point to some kind of
    terminator, typically a sentinel node or null, to facilitate traversal of
    the list. If there is only one sentinel node, then the list is circularly
    linked via the sentinel node. It can be conceptualized as two singly linked
    lists formed from the same data items, but in opposite sequential orders.

    The two node links allow traversal of the list in either direction. While
    adding or removing a node in a doubly linked list requires changing more
    links than the same operations on a singly linked list, the operations are
    simpler and potentially more efficient (for nodes other than first nodes)
    because there is no need to keep track of the previous node during
    traversal or no need to traverse the list to find the previous node, so
    that its link can be modified.
